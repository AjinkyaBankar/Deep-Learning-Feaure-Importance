# Explaining Feature Importance in Neural Network Models

**Overview

This repository contains Python code designed to demonstrate how to leverage powerful tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain feature importance in deep learning models using PyTorch.

While classical machine learning algorithms are often favored for tabular data due to their interpretability and ease of extracting feature importance, deep learning models typically excel at handling complex, non-linear data. However, these models are often perceived as "black boxes" because of the challenges involved in understanding their inner workings.

By using SHAP and LIME, we can bridge this gap, gaining valuable insights into feature importance and making more informed decisions, even when working with complex deep learning models.

**Key Features

- SHAP Integration: Utilize SHAP to explain the output of deep learning models, providing global and local interpretations of feature importance.
- LIME Integration: Use LIME to generate locally faithful explanations for model predictions, offering a clear understanding of how features influence individual predictions.
